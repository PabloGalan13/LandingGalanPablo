                I entered the ITSON University in Ciudad Obregón, Campus Nainari, in 2022.
                I am studying the Software Engineering program.

                I chose this career because of all the benefits it can offer. The field of technology, especially
                software programming, has grown tremendously in recent years. More and more companies and people need
                someone with knowledge in databases, cybersecurity, networks, and of course, programming. Everyone
                already has a website, an app, or something digital, and this is where the work of those with expertise
                comes in.

            <p>Due to the high demand and low supply, the salaries offered are very good for most people as they meet
                their needs and even their desires. It is important to highlight that, like anything, you must have a
                solid base of knowledge and experience, as well as at least one additional language, generally English.

                In addition to all of this, you have the opportunity to work remotely thanks to the nature of the
                projects you will be working on. It is not necessary to have the client physically present or your
                colleagues. You can work for a company in another country while being anywhere you want. It’s a great
                advantage.
