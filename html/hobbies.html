            <p>I have enjoyed technology since I can remember. At the age of 5, I was introduced to my first video game
                console, which became a hobby that has lasted to this day, and I can confidently say, for my entire
                life.</p>

            <p>I love football; it's my favorite sport since childhood. I used to practice it by training with a local
                team. Now, I only play in local leagues on weekends, and I enjoy it to the fullest. My favorite team in
                Mexico is Chivas de Guadalajara, and one of my dreams is to see the team in their stadium, the Akron
                Stadium in Zapopan, Jalisco.</p>

            <p>In addition to that, I am a big fan of superheroes. Since I was a child, my favorite hero has been
                Spider-Man. I have always liked his personality and his philosophy of helping those in need without
                expecting anything in return, someone who, despite all the challenges life has put in front of him,
                always knows how to rise again. That is one of my life philosophies.</p>
